        "desc": "Rokkan Kim (Jong Hyuk Kim) is a media artist who has been creating artworks that reinterpret the social scenes that we live in and American culture from the 1960s to the 70s.\nKim came across New Hollywood films when he was young and started to explore social phenomena like politics, ideology, design, fashion, and architecture from the movies. This marks the creation of the world of JFK-JHK—the initials of John F. Kennedy and Kim. Kim’s work covers numerous topics and industries that have inspired him since childhood. The “Space Oddity” series present spatial experience and ambivalent lives of astronauts, who were Kim’s childhood idols. The “Sea the Wall” collection alarms viewers about the earth’s climate change caused by environmental destruction. “May Be In My Past Life” looks into the supposed perspective of John F. Kennedy on the present, society, and politics. “The Occurrence of Thought” is the collection inspired by the design philosophy and architecture from the 1960s to now, with the stories from Kim’s grandfather, a veteran of the Korean War. “Fashion Component” is a graphic work that reassembles magazines and photos that inspired Kim when he studied fashion design at school."

However, there have been cases in which faulty building designs led to its collapse and caused unfortunate deaths. If we fail to structure and build our digital world correctly, there is a high risk of collapse. In order for this digital building to sustain itself beyond time and space, it is necessary to examine it from different perspectives and angles to harmonize the real and the virtual world. We must explore the direction of the future and understand the digital knowledge gap between the rich and the poor, whilst preserving human dignity and wisdom amid machine creation. Ultimately, we must create a solid base of the virtual space and open a Web3 world that can coexist and create synergy with reality."
