DAO is realized based on the NEITH Protocol composed of a total of 7 components: Station, Trust, Incinerator, Obelisk, Governance, Creator. DAO raises digital funds and distributes DAO Token through the Station. The raised digital funds are managed from the Treasury to DAO’s assets. The asset on consensus objective can be carried out through Trust, where entrusted with DAO’s name and authorization. It proceeds execution and management of the business. Through Trust, the business profits are distributed to the Treasury or Incinerator with promised proportions in the smart contract. The profits sent to the Treasury are managed as an asset of DAO. In Incinerator, the profit is used to purchase DAO Token being circulated. Purchased DAO token is then burned with proportion on the smart contract and sent to the Obelisk. As a result, DAO Token’s value rises through circulation reduction and may expect governance rewards through Staking pool. The management standards such as asset use of each DAOs, change of all distribution ratio may set or change through the Governance.

The Governance Token may be used to propose an agenda regarding DAO management or for voting.

    "title": "Nile Service Introduction & Terms",
    "txt": {
      "1": "NILE service is subject to digital assets. NILE service is available at the choice of the member and can be terminated at any time if not desired. However, the loss of deposits mentioned in this document may occur in the event of service withdrawal due to the member’s choice.",
      "2": "A member who agrees to the Service Use may use services such as DAO, NFT Marketplace, DApp recommendation etc. according to the periods provided within the Service. This is guided in a way that members can see from the service. All services that use digital assets of NILE service can be used after a member directly enters an amount and completes their signature.",
      "3": "NILE’s DAO(Decentralized Autonomous Organization) service is about generation and management of Decentralized Autonomous Organization operated through users autonomous participation and smart contract. DAO is realized based on the NEITH Protocol composed of a total of 7 components: Station, Trust, Incinerator, Obelisk, Governance, Creator. DAO raises digital funds and distributes DAO Token through the Station. The raised digital funds are managed from the Treasury to DAO’s assets. The asset on consensus objective can be carried out through Trust, where entrusted with DAO’s name and authorization. It proceeds execution and management of the business. Through Trust, the business profits are distributed to the Treasury or Incinerator with promised proportions in the smart contract. The profits sent to the Treasury are managed as an asset of DAO. In Incinerator, the profit is used to purchase DAO Token being circulated. Purchased DAO token is then burned with proportion on the smart contract and sent to the Obelisk. As a result, DAO Token’s value rises through circulation reduction and may expect governance rewards through Staking pool. The management standards such as asset use of each DAOs, change of all distribution ratio may set or change through the Governance. The DAO business may proceed with the core IP provider, Creator and the Creator may be granted with partial authority to the business profits.",
      "4": "The users in NILE’s DAO service may participate in DAO through stations of each DAO and send digital assets and will receive DAO Token equivalent to the amount of digital assets they participated in the Station when DAO is formed. Claimed DAO Token can be staked in DAO’s Taking Poll to acquire Governance Token or may hold DAO Token as it is. The Governance Token may be used to propose an agenda regarding DAO management or for voting. There is an exchange ratio of DAO Token and Governance Token in the Obelisk, and the relative exchange value of the Governance Token constantly rises as the DAO token is distributed in the Obelisk. Users can stake or unstake DAO Token with their own decision.",
      "5": "NILE’s NFT marketplace is a service where NFTs can be bought and traded. NFTs can be bought with an auction or fixed price depending on the type of sale and users may buy or not buy with their decision. Users who wish to participate in the auction may bid on the desired NFT and will win a bid once there are no higher bidders within the limited time. If a higher bidder appears, the auction time will be extended and the lower bidder may withdraw their bid or rebid in the auction.
